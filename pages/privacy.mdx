# Privacy.

RecordRig does not collect any personal data that you did not explicitely give us. We are committed to transparency and, as such, we do not follow you across websites, do not covertly collect your personal information, or any of the sort. And we certainly do not sell any personal information that you entrusted to us.

However, you should be aware that we do integrate with some external services, which might place cookies and/or have different terms. For example, we use embedded YouTube videos on this website, and if you decide to load these videos (after accepting cookies), Google/YouTube does place cookies which they tend to use to get to know more about your interests, so that they might target you with ads that will appeal more to you. Refer to our page on [Cookies](/cookies) for more information on this subject.

When you _do_ share your personal data with us, for example when you share your shipping address while placing an order, we're committed to making sure that this information is only used as you intended it to. For example, in the case of placing an order, we'll only use it to fulfil your order. If your order is fulfilled by a third party, such as an independent PC builder, we'll share your information with that person or business in particular so that they will be able to build and/or ship your PC. Of course, we'll also need to share your information with the business or person that will handle the delivery of your order.

We use [Stripe](https://stripe.com)'s payment platform to process payments. As such, we do not store or process your payment information ourselves. For example, when you use our Check Out and decide to pay by credit card, we'll have no idea what your credit card information was. We'll only know that your payment was successful, and will then carry on fulfilling your order. Your card details will only be handled by Stripe, who specialise in secure transactions and handling of sensitive data.

If you have any questions or concerns, please don't hesitate to contact us at [privacy@recordrig.com](mailto:privacy@recordrig.com).
