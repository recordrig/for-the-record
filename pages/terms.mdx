# Terms and conditions.

These are the Terms and Conditions for RecordRig. For our up-to-date contact information, please refer to our [Contact](/contact) page.

## Sales and refunds.

We're committed to keeping things simple so that you'll get to enjoy a smooth shopping experience. This is why we can keep our terms pretty short:

<ShipmentTerms />

<WarrantyTerms />

<WithdrawalTerms />

## Consumers only.

Our online RecordRig webshop sells and ships to end-user customers only. We reserve the right to refuse or cancel your order if we think you are purchasing for resale. (If you'd like to partner with us, [contact us](/contact).)

## Pricing and price reductions/corrections.

All prices are including VAT. We'll take care of the VAT behind the scenes, and clearly list the applied VAT percentage and amount on your invoice. The exact amount of VAT depends on your billing information, which we'll know only _after_ you've placed your order. We'll make sure that your online purchases will be taxed using the applicable sales tax or seller's use tax rate for your situation.

We reserve the right to change prices for products at any time, and to correct pricing errors that may inadvertently occur.

## Product availability and limitations.

In the cases of unexpected spikes in purchases and/or due to the supply constraints of some of our products, we may have to limit the number of products available for purchase. Trust us, we’re building our PC's as fast as we can.

We reserve the right to change quantities available for purchase at any time, even after you place an order. There may also be occasions when we confirm your order but subsequently learn that we cannot supply the ordered product. We will then cancel the order and refund your purchase price in full.

## Order acceptance/confirmation.

We may limit order quantity, and we additionally reserve the right at any time after receiving your order to accept or decline your order for any reason. We may also require additional qualifying information prior to accepting or processing any order. We might need to do this to, for example, to prevent potential fraud, or simply because due to an unexpected spike in orders we are not able to process such large amounts at any one time.

Once we start processing your order, we’ll provide you with an email order confirmation. This does not mean we've accepted your order; it just means that we've received your order. If we cancel an order after you have already been billed, we will refund the billed amount.

Once confirmed, we'll keep you up-to-date of your order status by email.

## Privacy.

Please refer to our [Privacy](/privacy) and [Cookies](/cookies) pages.

## A few final words.

We've tried to write these terms and conditions in such a manner that they are clear, but also fair to everyone. If you've any questions or concerns, please don't hesitate to [Contact](/contact) us. We'd appreciate any feedback, as well.

Happy [shop](/shop/buy-recordrig)ping!
