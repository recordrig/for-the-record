# Terms and Conditions.

These are the terms and conditions for RecordRig.

RecordRig is a trade name by DC Development. We develop software, build and repair PC's, sell consumer electronics and are based in the Netherlands.

We've made an effort to write these terms and conditions in such a manner that they are clear, as well as short enough so that you can read them within a manner of minutes, will prevent us from going bankrupt over something silly, but are also still fair to everyone. If you've any questions or concerns, please don't hesitate to [Contact](/contact) us.

## Content and copyright.

Though "copyright" is an automatic right pretty much everywhere, lawyers insist we spell some things out so that no misunderstandings may arise. So first, let's get this one out of the way:

All content contained on RecordRig websites as well as other types of publications by RecordRig is owned, controlled or licensed by or to RecordRig and protected by copyright laws. "Content" includes trade names, logos, articles, text, graphics, photographs, sounds, music, artwork and software, including the general design, structure, coordination, and expression, or "look and feel" of the website and other publications. Content may not be reproduced, distributed, transmitted, displayed, published or broadcast without the prior written permission of RecordRig. No part of RecordRig websites and other publications may be copied, photocopied, reproduced, translated or reduced to any electronic medium or machine-readable form, in whole or in part, without prior written consent of RecordRig. Any other reproduction in any form without the permission of RecordRig is strictly prohibited.

## Sales and refunds.

We're committed to doing what is needed so that you'll get to enjoy a smooth shopping experience. This is why we've kept these terms pretty simple:

<ShipmentTerms />

<WarrantyTerms />

<WithdrawalTerms />

### Consumers only.

Our online webshop sells and ships to end-user customers only. We reserve the right to refuse or cancel your order if we think you are purchasing for resale. (If you'd like to partner with us, [contact us](/contact) for a custom agreement and a bulk discount).

### Pricing and price reductions and/or corrections.

All listed prices already include VAT. We'll take care of the VAT behind the scenes, and will clearly list the applied VAT percentage and amount on your invoice. The exact amount of VAT depends on your billing information (tax rates tend to vary by region). We'll make sure that your online purchases will be taxed using the appropriate tax rate for your situation.

Of course, the total price will remain the same for you, and will not change due to VAT calculations after you've already placed your order. (Paid = paid.)

We do reserve the right to change prices for products at any time, and to correct pricing errors that may inadvertently occur.

### Product/parts availability and limitations.

We may sometimes have to limit the number of products available for purchase, for example in the case of unexpected spikes in purchases and/or due to the supply constraints of some of our products or parts. (Trust us, we’re building our PC's as fast as we can.)

When building your PC, we always make sure to use parts that will let you use your PC as intended. Due to parts availability, we may use varying brands or "flavours" of any one specific part. For example, the exact type of slotted graphics card might vary per PC. We do this to be able to live up to our estimation of delivery times, while still providing you with a PC that ticks all the intended usage boxes. We always test your PC extensively before shipping it to you, so you can trust that it will perform as intended.

As for product quantities, we reserve the right to change quantities available for purchase at any time, even after you place an order. There may also be occasions when we confirm your order but subsequently learn that we cannot supply the ordered product. We will then cancel the order and refund your purchase price in full.

### Order acceptance and confirmation.

We may limit order quantity, and we additionally reserve the right at any time after receiving your order to accept or decline your order for any reason. We may also require additional qualifying information prior to accepting or processing any order. This might be, for example, to prevent potential fraud, or simply because due to an unexpected spike in orders we are not able to process such large amounts at any one time.

Once we start processing your order, we’ll provide you with an order confirmation by email. This does not mean we've accepted your order; it just means that we've received your order. If we cancel an order after you have already been billed, we will refund the billed amount.

We will keep you up-to-date of your order status by email.

## Privacy.

Please refer to our [Privacy](/privacy) and [Cookies](/cookies) pages.

## A few final words.

Thank you for reading our terms and conditions. We know that it's never any fun, but we hope that at least it's been informative, and that it didn't take up too much of your time. If you've any questions or concerns, please don't hesitate to [Contact](/contact) us. We'd appreciate any feedback, as well.

Happy [shop](/shop/buy-recordrig)ping!
