# Privacy.

RecordRig does not collect any personal data that you did not explicitely give us. We are committed to transparency and, as such, we do not follow you across websites, covertly collect device and usage information, or any of the sort.

However, you should be aware that we do integrate with some external services, who might place cookies. For example, we use embedded YouTube videos on this website. Refer to our page on [Cookies (and similar technologies)](/cookies) for more information on this subject.

When you _do_ share your data with us, for example when you share your shipping address while placing an order, we're committed to making sure that this information is only used as you intended it to. For example, in the case of placing an order, we'll only use it to fulfil your order. If your order is fulfilled by a third party, such as an independent PC builder, we'll share your information with that person or business in particular so that they will be able to build and/or ship your PC.

We use [Stripe](https://stripe.com)'s payment platform to process payments. As such, we do not store your payment information ourselves. For example, when you use our Check Out and decide to pay by credit card, we'll have no idea what your credit card information was. We'll only know that your payment was successful, and will then carry on fulfilling your order. Your card details will only be handled by Stripe, who specialise in secure transactions and handling of sensitive data.

If you have any questions or concerns, please don't hesitate to contact us at [privacy@recordrig.com](mailto:privacy@recordrig.com).
