# Cookies.

RecordRig uses "cookies" and similar technologies. On this page, we'll inform you of our cookie use. Feel free te adjust your cookie settings anytime.

## What are cookies?

Cookies are small text files that websites place on your computer or mobile device as you browse the web. Cookies — and similar technologies — help websites to do many things, like implementing a shopping bag, remembering your preferences, and generally improving the user experience.

Cookies are also widely used by websites for marketing purposes. For example, advertisement companies might place a cookie to recognise you across various websites, so that they might build up a profile of your interests, in order to target you with ads more relevant to you.

## How and why do we use cookies?

Though RecordRig currently does not place any cookies directly ("1st party cookies"), we do make use of some services that will place cookies when used ("3rd party cookies"):

1. Google/YouTube will place cookies when you decide to load an embedded YouTube video. We'll ask you if you agree with YouTube's/Google's Terms before loading any YouTube videos.

## What is local storage?

Local storage allows a website to store information locally on your computer or mobile device. In that sense, it can be used to implement many things you could also implement with cookies, such as shopping bags and remembering your preferences.

Local storage is mainly used to store and retrieve data in HTML pages from the same domain.

## How and why do we use local storage? 

RecordRig uses your browser's local storage to implement the following: 

1. RecordRig saves your Shopping Bag contents in your browser's local storage (just the product ID's and quantity) so that your Shopping Bag can be recovered when you revisit.
2. RecordRig saves your cookie preferences settings so that you don't need to re-submit your cookie preferences every time you revisit the website.

## Your browser's settings.

You can clear your browser's cookies and local storage, or even turn off cookies entirely, through your browser's settings. Please note that our website's features might not work optimally, or not at all, if you do.
