            Each RecordRig dedicated streaming PC is assembled and tested
            individually, just for you, to make sure that each single unit that
            we ship can do exactly what it should do, without hiccups. Say
            goodbye to the many days or weeks of PC parts selection +
            assemblage, random driver problems and the various compatibility
            issues involved in building your own PC. A RecordRig is guaranteed
            to always be delivered with the ready-to-go capability of recording
            4K 60FPS + HDR, and to interface well with the PS4 Pro, Xbox One X
            or your Windows gaming PC.
